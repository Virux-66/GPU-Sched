These were run anually on sloppyjoe (on the GTX 1080). I just kicked off
the zero scheduler in the background (so the jobs wouldn't block when they hit
their beacons). And then I executed the jobs directly with the little driver
in the folder. Then I saved the results and had a little parser script to
grab all the kernel and cuda memcpy times.

Thus, I didn't update run-experiment.sh (or workloader.py for that matter) to
suppor the zero scheduler or to look for these workload files.
